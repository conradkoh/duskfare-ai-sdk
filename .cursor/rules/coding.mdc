# Coding Rules

## Principles & Code Quality

ALWAYS apply Dependency Inversion to make code testable
ALWAYS ensure that generated code has TSDoc comments
SHOULD prefer to modify files rather than create new ones to prevent excessive new file changes

## Testing & Validation

NEVER write tests unless requested
NEVER attempt to run the dev server or the build command unless explicitly asked by the user

## Documentation and Notes

- ALWAYS write to ONLY ONE doc file that consolidates all your changes in the session unless explicitly asked by the user
- ALWAYS prefer to keep wording concise and to the point
- ALWAYS prefer to use code to represent complex concepts when words may be ambiguous
- ALWAYS use typescript interfaces to represent data models, contracts
